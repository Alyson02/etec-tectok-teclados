We are using MySQL as the database.

## Setting up

To create the database and the tables, execute the `setup.sql` file, it will:

- Create a new database `etec_tectok_teclados`;
- Create a table for the product categories;
- Create a table for the products.

## Populating

Once the database is created, data can be inserted as you prefer. But is recommended to execute the `base_data.sql` file, it creates basic categories and products.
